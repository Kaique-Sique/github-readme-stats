# 🤖 Off Season Repository

Welcome to the official code repository for the **2025 Megazord Robot (FRC Team 7563)**. This documentation provides an overview of the robot's subsystems, control systems, and how to interact with the codebase.

---

## Best Practices

## 1. Branching Strategy:

- **Main/Master Branch:** This branch should always represent the stable, deployable code that is known to work on the robot. Only merge well-tested and reviewed code into this branch.
  
- **Feature Branches:** For every new feature, bug fix, or significant change, create a dedicated feature branch from the main branch. This isolates your work and prevents breaking the main codebase.
  
- **Issue Branches:** Link feature branches to specific issues or tasks in your project management system (e.g., GitHub Issues). This provides clear context for each change.

## 2. Version Control Workflow:

- **Regular Commits:** Commit changes frequently with clear, descriptive commit messages. This creates a detailed history of your work and makes it easier to revert if needed.

- **Pull Requests (PRs):** Use pull requests for code review before merging into main. This allows teammates to review code, provide feedback, and catch potential issues.

- **Code Reviews:** Encourage thorough code reviews, focusing on functionality, style, and adherence to FRC best practices and team standards.

- **Testing:** Deploy and thoroughly test code from feature branches on the robot before merging into main. This ensures the changes work as expected in a real-world environment.

## 3. Repository Structure and Organization:

- **Clear Folder Structure:** Organize your code logically within the repository (e.g., src/main/java, src/main/cpp, lib).

- **README.md:** Include a comprehensive README.md file with instructions on how to set up the development environment, build the code, and deploy to the robot.

- **Documentation:** Document key code sections, complex algorithms, and hardware interfaces to aid understanding and maintainability.

## 4. Team Collaboration:

- **Communication:** Maintain open communication within the team regarding code changes, progress, and any issues encountered.
  
- **Conflict Resolution:** Address merge conflicts promptly and collaboratively.
  
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Encourage knowledge sharing and mentorship among team members, especially for new programmers.
